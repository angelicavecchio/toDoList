## To-Do List Manager

The To-Do List Manager is a  Java-based application designed to help users manage their daily tasks. It allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks, while also providing a mechanism to save the task list to a CSV file. This application demonstrates basic object-oriented programming principles and offers a clean, intuitive interface for managing tasks with specific due dates.

The app is designed to be scalable, allowing for easy extensions such as adding task categories, priority levels, or integration with external APIs.

## Key Features

1) Task Management: Add tasks with descriptions and due dates, view the list of tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them as needed.

2) State Management: Tasks are tracked with a state (e.g., [Pending], [Done]) that can be updated as users complete tasks.

3) File Saving: Tasks can be saved to a CSV file, providing persistent storage across application sessions.

4) User-friendly Interface: The application offers an intuitive text-based interface to make task management easy for both beginners and advanced users.

5) Input Validation: Robust error handling ensures that users input valid data (task number, date format, etc.), enhancing the user experience and preventing crashes.
